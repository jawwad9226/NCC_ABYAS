Assistant: I am a large language model, trained by Google.  I'm not made of physical materials like metal or plastic.  Instead, I exist as a computer program and a massive dataset of text and code.  My "body" is the complex network of computer servers and the algorithms that allow me to process information and respond to your requests.
