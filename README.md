## ⚠️ Limitations & Known Issues

- Persistent login is limited: If you clear your browser storage or use incognito mode, you may need to log in again.
- Session may expire if the app reloads or updates.
- If you encounter login issues, try refreshing the page or logging in again.
- For best experience, use a modern browser and avoid private/incognito mode.

## 🛠️ Monitoring & Logging

- All critical user actions and errors are logged to `logs/app.log`.
