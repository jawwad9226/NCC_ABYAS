        "question": "You are leading a patrol through dense jungle.  Which method best balances speed and security?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Maintaining a tight, single-file formation for maximum speed.",
          "B": "Employing a loose, bounding overwatch formation to increase situational awareness.",
          "C": "Using a wide, spread-out formation to cover more ground quickly.",
          "D": "Maintaining radio silence to avoid detection."
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bounding overwatch allows for speed while maintaining security through alternating fire and movement.  A tight formation is vulnerable, a wide formation is less secure, and radio silence is only one aspect of security.",

        "question": "Your patrol is ambushed.  What is the priority of actions immediately following the initial contact?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Return fire and eliminate the enemy.",
          "B": "Immediately retreat to a pre-planned rally point.",
          "C": "Establish a base of fire and maneuver to a better position.",
          "D": "Call for immediate air support."
        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While returning fire is important, the priority is to improve the tactical situation.  Establishing a base of fire and maneuvering to a better position allows for more effective return fire and reduces casualties.  Retreating without a plan is risky, and air support takes time.",

          "D": "Concealment and cover from enemy observation."
        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A large landmark draws attention and compromises concealment.  Fields of fire, proximity to friendly forces, and concealment are all crucial for a successful OP.",

          "D": "Maintaining complete radio silence to avoid detection."
        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Over-reliance on any single sense is dangerous.  Combining night vision with other senses provides a more complete picture of the environment.  Radio silence is important but doesn't replace situational awareness.",
