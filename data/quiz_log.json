        "question": "A map uses a scale of 1:50,000.  A river is depicted as 2cm wide on the map.  Which statement is most accurate regarding the actual width of the river?",
        "options": {
          "A": "The river is exactly 1km wide.",
          "B": "The river is approximately 1km wide.",
          "C": "The river is likely less than 1km wide, but the exact width cannot be determined without further information.",
          "D": "The river is likely more than 1km wide, but the exact width cannot be determined without further information."
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "2cm on the map represents 2cm * 50,000 = 100,000cm in reality. Converting to kilometers, this is 1km.  However, map representations are approximations, so \"approximately\" is the most accurate descriptor.",

        "question": "Analyzing a map showing isohyets (lines of equal rainfall), you observe closely spaced isohyets in a particular region. What can you infer about this region?",
        "options": {
          "A": "The region experiences uniform rainfall distribution.",
          "B": "The region experiences minimal rainfall.",
          "C": "The region experiences a steep rainfall gradient.",
          "D": "The region experiences consistent, moderate rainfall."
        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Closely spaced isohyets indicate a rapid change in rainfall amount over a short distance, signifying a steep rainfall gradient.",

        "question": "A map uses UTM coordinates. You are given the coordinates of two points and need to determine the distance between them.  Which method would be MOST accurate for calculating the distance?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Using a simple Pythagorean theorem calculation on the easting and northing differences.",
          "B": "Measuring the distance directly on the map using a ruler and applying the map scale.",
          "C": "Using a geographic information system (GIS) software with appropriate geodetic calculations.",
          "D": "Estimating the distance based on the visual representation on the map."
        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "UTM coordinates are based on a projected coordinate system, and simple Pythagorean calculations will not account for the curvature of the Earth.  GIS software offers the most accurate method for calculating distances using appropriate geodetic calculations that consider the Earth's shape.",
