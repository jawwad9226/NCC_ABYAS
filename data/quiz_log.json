          "A": "The river is exactly 1km wide.",
          "B": "The river is approximately 1km wide.",
          "C": "The river is likely less than 1km wide, but the exact width cannot be determined without further information.",
          "D": "The river is likely more than 1km wide, but the exact width cannot be determined without further information."
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "2cm on the map represents 2cm * 50,000 = 100,000cm in reality. Converting to kilometers, this is 1km.  However, map representations are approximations, so \"approximately\" is the most accurate descriptor.",
