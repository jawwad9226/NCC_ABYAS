    "response": "MOQ stands for **Minimum Order Quantity**.  A MOQ question is any question related to the minimum number of units a supplier requires a buyer to purchase in a single order.  These questions can take many forms, such as:\n\n* **Direct questions:** \"What is your MOQ for product X?\"  \"What is the minimum quantity I need to order to get a discount?\"\n* **Indirect questions:**  \"What are your pricing tiers?\" (Pricing tiers often depend on order quantity, revealing the MOQ implicitly). \"What's the smallest order you can fulfill?\"\n* **Questions embedded in negotiations:** \"Could you consider a lower MOQ for a first-time order?\"  \"If I commit to a larger order in the future, can we negotiate a lower MOQ now?\"\n\nEssentially, any question aiming to determine the smallest order size a supplier will accept is a MOQ question."
