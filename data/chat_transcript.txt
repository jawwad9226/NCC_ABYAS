* **Confidence and Bearing:**  Mastering drill techniques boosts cadets' confidence and improves their posture and bearing, contributing to a more assertive and self-assured demeanor.

* **Leadership Skills:** Senior cadets often lead drill sessions, providing opportunities to develop leadership skills, including planning, organization, and communication.

In essence, drill in NCC is a fundamental training method that goes beyond simple marching. It's a powerful tool for developing essential life skills and character traits valued in both military and civilian life.
